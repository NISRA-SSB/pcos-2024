**BACKGROUND**
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
In 2008 the Statistics Authority was set up as a non-Ministerial government department with a remit to improve public confidence and trust in official statistics. In 2009, questions relating to Public Awareness of and Trust in Official Statistics were placed in the Northern Ireland Omnibus Survey. The questions were repeated in even years from 2010 to 2016, and have been asked annually in the Continuous Household Survey (CHS) since 2019, with awareness of NISRA asked in 2018.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Official statistics (which include Accredited Official Statistics[^1]) are statistics produced by Government departments and agencies, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and by other Crown bodies.  Official statistics are fundamental to good government, to the delivery of public services and to decision-making in all sectors of society. The majority of Northern Ireland official statistics are produced by NISRA staff. NISRA branches can be found within all NICS Departments and many Arm’s Length Bodies.
:::

[^1]: [`r f_format_link("Accredited official statistics")`](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/accredited-official-statistics/) are called National Statistics in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007


:::{custom-style="numbered_point_2after"}
The [`r f_format_link("Code of Practice for Statistics")`](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/), produced by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), outlines the principles and detailed practices that producers of official statistics must commit to when producing and releasing official statistics. It is based on three pillars:
:::

:::{custom-style="bullet_style"}
**Trustworthiness** is about having confidence in the people and organisations that produce statistics and data.
:::

:::{custom-style="bullet_style"}
**Quality** is about using data and methods that produce assured statistics.
:::

:::{custom-style="last_bullet_style"}
**Value** is about producing statistics that support society’s needs for information.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}    
The `r current_year` survey questions were asked in the CHS between `r survey_start_mth` and `r survey_end_mth` `r current_year`. A total of `r sample_size` persons, aged 16 and over living in private households, answered the questions. All percentages are based on a representative sample of the population and are therefore estimates.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
The key findings from the statistics bulletin [`r f_format_link(paste0("Public Awareness of and Trust in Official Statistics Northern Ireland ", current_year))`](https://datavis.nisra.gov.uk/ssb/public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`.html) are outlined below. 
:::
:::{custom-style="indent_text"}
Detailed tables accompany the report and include the statistics underlying the charts and commentary as well as further breakdowns. Infographics on ‘`r f_red_text("Public Awareness of NISRA")`’ and ‘`r f_red_text("Public Trust in Official Statistics")`’ are also available:

**KEY FINDINGS**
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Awareness of NISRA**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Public awareness of NISRA is `r f_red_text("moderate")`, with `r f_red_text("almost half")` of respondents (`r heard_of_nisra`%) indicating they had heard of the Agency before being contacted about the survey.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Awareness of NISRA `r f_red_text("has decreased since 2021, when 55%")` of respondents had heard of NISRA, but `r f_red_text("remains notably higher than in previous years (2009 to 2019) when 35% or less")` respondents had heard of NISRA.
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Trust in NISRA**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Trust in NISRA as an institution is `r f_red_text("high")`, with `r trust_in_nisra`% of respondents trusting NISRA a great deal or tending to trust NISRA. This is `r f_red_text("higher")` than the level of trust in the Civil Service (`r trust_in_nics`%) and compares `r f_red_text("very favourably")` with the media (`r trust_in_media`%) and the Northern Ireland Assembly (`r trust_in_assem_elect_body`%). Trust levels `r f_red_text("increase")` to `r heard_of_and_trust_nisra`% amongst those that have heard of NISRA by name.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Trust in NISRA in `r current_year` (`r trust_in_nisra`%) remains `r f_red_text("higher than in 2019 (80%)")`, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The level of trust in NISRA is `r f_red_text("similar")` to the level of trust in the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) (`r trust_in_ons`%). However, when only those who gave an opinion, i.e. excluding ‘don’t knows’, are considered, trust levels are `r f_red_text("higher")` for NISRA.
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Trust in NISRA statistics**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Public trust in the statistics produced by NISRA is `r f_red_text("also high")` (`r trust_in_nisra_stats`%). Among those that have heard of NISRA by name, trust in NISRA statistics `r f_red_text("increases")` to `r heard_of_and_trust_nisra_stats`%.
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
For respondents who gave an opinion, there was `r f_red_text("no significant difference")` in the level of trust in NISRA statistics between `r current_year - 1` and `r current_year`. However for these respondents, trust in NISRA statistics is `r f_red_text("higher in 2022 compared to 2019 and previous years.")`
:::

:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
Trust in NISRA statistics is `r f_red_text("similar")` to the level of trust in ONS statistics (`r trust_in_ons_stats`%). However, distrust in NISRA statistics (`r distrust_nisra_stats`%) is `r f_red_text("notably lower")` than distrust in ONS statistics (`r distrust_ons_stats`%).
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Value**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
The statistics produced by NISRA are `r f_red_text("valued")`, with `r importance_of_stats`% of respondents agreeing that statistics produced by NISRA are important to understand Northern Ireland.
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Political Interference**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
`r f_red_text("Over four-fifths")` (`r free_from_interference`%) of respondents believe that statistics produced by NISRA are free from political interference. The `r f_red_text("majority")` of the remaining respondents don’t know (`r dont_know_interference`%), while `r f_red_text("1 in 20")` (`r disagree_interference`%) disagree.
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Confidentiality**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point_2after"}
`r f_red_text("Over nine out of every ten")` (`r agree_confidential`%) respondents agree that personal information provided to NISRA is kept confidential.
:::
:::{custom-style="left_text"}
<br>
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Likely Media Interest**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point"}
The release of these statistics historically has not generated any significant media interest. There is an accompanying Statistical Press Release and the release has been publicised through NISRA social media channels. Officials will handle any press enquiries should there be a need.
:::

:::{custom-style="heading_4after"}
**Recommendation**
:::
:::{custom-style="numbered_point_2after"}
The Minister is invited to note:
:::

:::{custom-style="roman_point"}
the results of the public opinion survey on public awareness of and trust in official statistics; and

the publication of the Statistics Bulletin today (`r pub_date_words_dmy`).
