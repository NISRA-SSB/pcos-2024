## Overview

This report presents findings on public awareness of NISRA (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency) and trust in official statistics in Northern Ireland. The questions were asked in the Northern Ireland Continuous Household Survey (CHS) between `r survey_start_mth` and `r survey_end_mth` `r current_year`. The report also monitors changes over time and includes comparisons with the latest available data for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), where appropriate. The figures presented in this report were obtained from a representative sample of the Northern Ireland population (`r sample_size` persons) and are therefore estimates. The key findings are:

**Awareness**

-   In `r current_year`, over two-fifths of respondents (`r heard_of_nisra`%) indicated that they had heard of the Agency before being contacted about the survey. This is lower than 2023, when 48% of respondents had heard of NISRA.


**Trust**

-   Public trust in NISRA, as an institution, is high (`r trust_in_nisra`%). Of those that had heard of NISRA, 90% stated that they trusted the Agency.

-   Public trust in the statistics produced by NISRA is also high (`r trust_in_nisra_stats`%).

**Value**

-   The statistics produced by NISRA are valued, with `r importance_of_stats`% of respondents agreeing that statistics produced by NISRA are important to understand Northern Ireland.

**Political Interference**

-   Almost four-fifths (`r free_from_interference`%) of respondents agree that statistics produced by NISRA are free from political interference.

## Introduction

Official Statistics in Northern Ireland are produced by Government Departments, and in some cases Arm’s Length Bodies. The data collection, production, presentation and dissemination of official statistics are governed by the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/).

> *This Code plays an essential role in ensuring that statistics published by government command public confidence through demonstrating trustworthiness and providing high quality statistics that enhance public value.*
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('Preamble, Code of Practice')`

NISRA is an Agency within the Department of Finance and provides statistical services across government in Northern Ireland. The majority of [Northern Ireland official statistics](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/official-statistics/northern-ireland-official-statistics) are produced by NISRA staff and NISRA branches can be found within all Northern Ireland Departments, and several Arm’s Length Bodies. NISRA has been measuring the levels of public confidence or trust in the Agency and in the statistics it produces since the Code was produced in 2009. These levels are monitored by the Agency and used to inform communication and marketing strategies.

In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the largest producer of official statistics. Public trust in the ONS and the statistics it produces are also monitored and this report contains comparisons between NISRA and ONS. The ONS survey samples respondents in England, Scotland and Wales whilst the NISRA survey samples respondents in Northern Ireland. The most recent ONS survey was conducted in `r ons_year` ([Public Confidence in Official Statistics `r ons_year` (ONS)](https://natcen.ac.uk/publications/public-confidence-official-statistics)).

Detailed tables are published alongside this report. These include the source data for all the charts and commentary and additional breakdowns (see [Appendix B](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-b.html)).

Differences are only noted in the commentary when they are likely to represent a real difference taking account of the margin of error in the sample-based estimates (see ‘Survey Estimates’ in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-methodology-and-quality-information) for further detail).

## 1. Awareness of NISRA

### Current year, `r current_year`

Just over two-fifths of respondents (`r heard_of_nisra`%) said they had heard of NISRA before being contacted about the survey.

### Comparison over time

Awareness is lower than in 2023, when 48% of respondents had heard of NISRA. Public awareness of NISRA has decreased gradually since 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) but remains higher than in 2019 and earlier years (Chart 1).

#### Chart 1: Awareness of NISRA (2009-`r current_year`)

```{r Chart 1, fig.alt = "Line graph showing awareness of NISRA. Awareness of NISRA ranged between 30% and 35% between 2009-2019, before rising to 58% in 2020 and then gradually decreasing to 48% in 2023"}

```

### Comparison with ONS

Public awareness of NISRA remains lower than awareness of ONS, with three quarters (`r aware_of_ons`%) of respondents having heard of ONS in 2023 (the latest available data). The difference between public awareness levels for NISRA and ONS has narrowed since 2018, which was before the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart 2).

## 2. Awareness of NISRA Statistics

### Awareness of NISRA statistics, where not previously heard of NISRA

Respondents who had not previously heard of NISRA were asked whether they had heard of specific NISRA statistics. `r not_heard_aware_none`% of these respondents had not heard of any of the statistics listed, while `r not_heard_aware_all`% had heard of all the statistics. A more detailed breakdown is available in the accompanying tables (see [Appendix B](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-b.html)).

Just over half (`r not_heard_aware_census`%) of those respondents who had not previously heard of NISRA were aware of the Northern Ireland Census, and almost two in five (`r not_heard_aware_hospital`%) were aware of statistics on hospital waiting times. However, less than one in ten (`r not_heard_aware_cycling`%) of these respondents had heard of statistics on journeys made by walking, cycling or public transport in Northern Ireland (Chart 3).

### Awareness of statistics produced by NISRA, where heard of NISRA

Respondents who had heard of NISRA were asked whether they were aware that NISRA produced certain statistics. Of these respondents, `r heard_aware_all`% were aware that NISRA produced all the listed statistics while `r heard_aware_none`% were unaware that NISRA produced any of the listed statistics. A more detailed breakdown is available in the accompanying tables (see [Appendix B](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-b.html)).

Awareness was highest for the Northern Ireland Census (`r heard_aware_census`%), followed by statistics on the number of people who live in Northern Ireland (`r heard_aware_people`%), and the unemployment rate (`r heard_aware_unemployment`%). Statistics on  the percentage of journeys made by walking, cycling or public transport (`r heard_of_aware_cycling`%) were the least recognised as being produced by NISRA (Chart 4).

## 3. Trust in NISRA

### Current year, `r current_year`

Trust in NISRA as an institution is high, with `r trust_in_nisra`% of all respondents trusting NISRA a great deal or tending to trust NISRA. Most of the remaining respondents (`r dont_know_trust_nisra`%) didn’t know whether they trusted NISRA or not, while `r distrust_nisra`% of respondents tended to distrust or distrusted NISRA greatly (Chart 5). Trust in NISRA was higher among those who had heard of NISRA (`r heard_of_and_trust_nisra`%). Further detail is available in the accompanying tables (see [Appendix B](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-b.html)).

### Comparison over time

Trust in NISRA is lower in 2024 than in 2023 (83%). Since 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), trust in NISRA has decreased from 90% to `r trust_in_nisra`%, and the percentage of respondents answering 'don't know' has increased from 7% to `r dont_know_trust_nisra`%. The level of distrust in NISRA has also increased from 2% to `r distrust_nisra`%. Current trust levels are comparable to those recorded in 2019 and earlier years (Chart 5).

#### Chart 5: Trust in NISRA (2014-`r current_year`)

###	Comparison with ONS

Trust in NISRA in 2024 is lower than trust in ONS (`r trust_in_ons`%) in 2023, the latest available data (Chart 6). However, when only those who gave an opinion are considered, i.e. excluding 'don't knows', trust in NISRA is higher.

#### Chart 6: Trust in NISRA (`r current_year`) and ONS (`r ons_year`) as institutions

```{r Chart 6, fig.alt = "Vertical stacked bar chart showing trust in NISRA and ONS as institutions. Trust in NISRA, represented by the dark blue segment, was 83% in 2023, compared to 83% for ONS. Distrust in NISRA, represented by the light blue segment, was 4% compared to 13% for ONS. Don't know responses (13% for NISRA, 5% for ONS) are represented by grey segments."}

  } else {
    paste0("Table 3.1b: Trust in NISRA (", current_year, ") and ONS (", ons_year, ")")
  },
  tab_name = "trust_nisra_ons")

```

###	Comparison with other institutions

Trust in NISRA is significantly higher than trust in the media and the NI Assembly, and similar to trust in the Civil Service (Chart 7). However, when only those respondents who expressed an opinion are considered, i.e. excluding 'don't knows', trust in NISRA is higher than trust in the Civil Service.

Across all institutions, trust is lowest for the media (`r trust_in_media`%) and the NI Assembly (`r trust_in_assem_elect_body`%), while `r trust_in_nics`% of respondents said they trust the Civil Service.

A higher percentage of respondents don’t know if they trust NISRA or not (`r dont_know_trust_nisra`%) compared to other institutions.

## 4. Trust in NISRA Statistics

### Current year, `r current_year`

The majority of respondents (`r trust_in_nisra_stats`%) trust NISRA statistics a great deal or tend to trust them while `r distrust_nisra_stats`% of respondents distrust NISRA statistics greatly or tend to distrust them. The remaining respondents (`r dont_know_trust_nisra_stats`%) don’t know whether they trust NISRA statistics or not (Chart 8). 

Trust in NISRA statistics is higher among those who have heard of NISRA as an institution (`r heard_of_and_trust_nisra_stats`%). Further detail is available in the accompanying tables (see [Appendix B](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-b.html)).

### Comparison over time

Trust in NISRA statistics in 2024 is similar to 2023 and 2022, when 85% of respondents expressed trust, and years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. before 2020. However, it is lower than the levels recorded in 2020 and 2021 (Chart 8). 

When only those respondents who expressed an opinion are considered, i.e. excluding 'don't knows', trust in NISRA statistics in 2024 is lower than in 2023 and 2022.


#### Chart 8: Trust in NISRA statistics (2014-`r current_year`)

  sheet_title = paste0("Table 4a: Trust in NISRA statistics, 2014 to ", current_year), 
  tab_name = "trust_stats", startyear = 2014)

```

###	Comparison with ONS

The level of trust in NISRA statistics (`r trust_in_nisra_stats`%) in 2024 is similar to the level of trust in ONS statistics (`r trust_in_ons_stats`%), based on the latest available data (2023). However, distrust in ONS statistics (`r distrust_ons_stats`%) is significantly higher than distrust in NISRA statistics (`r distrust_nisra_stats`%) (Chart 9).

More respondents answered 'don't know' with regard to NISRA statistics (`r dont_know_trust_nisra_stats`%) than for ONS statistics (`r dont_know_trust_ons_stats`%).

#### Chart 9: Trust in statistics produced by NISRA (`r current_year`) and ONS (`r ons_year`)

## 5. Value

### Current year, `r current_year`

The majority of respondents (`r importance_of_stats`%) agree that the statistics produced by NISRA are important to understand Northern Ireland. Most of the remaining respondents (`r dont_know_importance`%) don’t know, while `r disagree_importance`% of respondents disagree that statistics produced by NISRA are important to understand Northern Ireland (Chart 10).

### Comparison over time

The percentage of respondents agreeing that NISRA statistics are important to understand Northern Ireland in 2024 is not significantly different from 2023 (89%) but is lower than earlier years (2019 to 2022) (Chart 10).

When only those respondents who had a view are considered, i.e. excluding 'don't knows', agreement that NISRA statistics are important to understand Northern Ireland is lower than in 2020 to 2023 but similar to 2019 and 2016.


#### Chart 10: NISRA statistics are important to understand Northern Ireland (2016-`r current_year`)

```{r Chart 10, fig.alt = "Vertical bar chart showing belief that NISRA statistics are important to understand Northern Ireland - agree responses in dark blue, disagree responses in light blue, and don't know responses in grey. Each bar represents a different year."}

```

###	Comparison with ONS

The same percentage of NISRA and ONS respondents (`r importance_of_stats`%) agree that the statistics produced are important to understand their country.

While NISRA respondents are more likely to answer ‘don’t know’ (`r dont_know_importance`%) than ONS respondents (`r dont_know_importance_ons`%), the percentage of respondents who disagree is notably lower for NISRA (`r disagree_importance`%) than it is for ONS (`r disagre_importance_ons`%) (Chart 11).


#### Chart 11: Statistics produced are important to understand our country, NISRA (`r current_year`) and ONS (`r ons_year`)

```{r Chart 11, fig.alt = "Vertical bar chart showing belief that statistics produced by each institution are important in understanding the country. 89% for NISRA in 2022, 87% for ONS in 2021."}

  },
  tab_name = "trust_nisra_ons_stats")

```

## 6. Political Interference

### Current year, `r current_year`

Almost four-fifths (`r free_from_interference`%) of respondents agree that statistics produced by NISRA are free from political interference. One tenth (`r disagree_interference`%) of respondents disagree that NISRA statistics are free from political interference whilst the remaining respondents (`r dont_know_interference`%) answered that they ‘don’t know’ (Chart 12).

### Comparison over time

Agreement that NISRA statistics are free from political interference is not significantly different to 2023 but lower than in earlier years (2019 to 2022). However, when only those respondents who expressed an opinion are considered, agreement has fallen since 2023. 

The percentage of respondents disagreeing that NISRA statistics are free from political interference (`r disagree_interference`%) has increased since 2023 (7%).

#### Chart 12: NISRA statistics are free from political interference (2014-`r current_year`)

```{r Chart 12, fig.alt = "Vertical bar chart, each bar represents a different year. Agree responses are in dark blue, disagree responses in light blue, don't know responses are in grey."}

  sheet_title = paste0("Table 6a: Statistics produced by NISRA are free from political interference, 2014 to ", current_year),
  tab_name = "political_nisra", startyear = 2014)

```

###	Comparison with ONS

In comparison, `r free_from_interference_ons`% of respondents agree that statistics produced by ONS are free from political interference (Chart 13). This is significantly lower than the NISRA figure.

#### Chart 13: Statistics produced are free from political interference, NISRA (`r current_year`) and ONS (`r ons_year`)

```{r Chart 13, fig.alt = "Vertical stacked bar chart showing belief that statistics are free from political interference. Belief that NISRA statistics are free from interference is at 80% in 2023 (dark blue segment), compared to 67% for ONS in 2023."}

  tab_name = "political_nisra_ons")

```

## 7. Confidentiality

### Current year, `r current_year`

Eighty-five percent of respondents (`r agree_confidential`%) agree that personal information provided to NISRA will be kept confidential while `r disagree_confidential`% disagree. The remaining respondents 'don’t know' (`r dont_know_confidential`%) (Chart 14).

### Comparison over time

The percentage of respondents agreeing that personal information provided to NISRA will be kept confidential is the same as in 2023, but lower than in previous years. When only those respondents who expressed an opinion are considered, agreement in 2024 is similar to 2023, 2014 and 2016.

Disagreement with the statement is similar to 2023, but higher than in the previous four years (2019 to 2022) and similar to 2014 and 2016.


#### Chart 14: Personal information provided to NISRA will be kept confidential (2014-`r current_year`)

```{r Chart 14, fig.alt = "Vertical bar chart, each bar represents a different year. Agree responses are in dark blue, disagree responses in light blue, don't know responses are in grey."}

  sheet_title = paste0("Table 7a: Personal information provided to NISRA will be kept confidential, 2014 to ", current_year),
  tab_name = "confidential_nisra", startyear = 2014)

```

###	Comparison with ONS

In comparison, `r agree_confidential_ons`% of ONS respondents in `r ons_year` (the latest available data) agree that personal information provided to ONS will be kept confidential. This is higher than for NISRA (Chart 15).

However when respondents who answered 'don't know' are excluded, the level of agreement is higher for NISRA than for ONS. This is because NISRA respondents are more likely to answer 'don't know' (8%) than ONS respondents (2%) and less likely to disagree: 6% for NISRA compared to 10% for ONS.

#### Chart 15: Belief that personal information provided will be kept confidential, NISRA (`r current_year`) and ONS (`r ons_year`)

```{r Chart 15, fig.alt = "Vertical bar chart showing belief that personal information will be kept confidential by institution. In 2023, 85% believed that NISRA would keep personal information confidential (dark blue segment), compared to 88% for ONS in 2023."}

## Appendix A: Methodology and Quality Information

### Data Source

This report presents the results of questions relating to Public Awareness and Trust in Official Statistics in Northern Ireland that were included in the Continuous Household Survey (CHS). The CHS is one of the largest continuous surveys carried out in Northern Ireland, designed and administered by the Central Survey Unit (CSU), NISRA. Prior to 2018, the questions were included as a module within the NI Omnibus Survey but following the temporary suspension of the NI Omnibus Survey in 2018, the questions were moved to the CHS. Both surveys use probabilistic sampling to select a representative sample of the general population, aged 16 and over, resident in private households. This means that comparisons can continue to be made over time and significance tests carried out to determine if observed differences are likely to be real or due to sampling error.

```{r Processing Note}

# Update the number of addresses selected, mid-year estimates used for weighting, and achieved response rate in Appendix A (and check everything else is correct), as these updates could easily be missed, as a lot of the other info is automated.

```

Each year CSU sets the content of the CHS questionnaire in consultation with clients. The questionnaire consists of both an overall household interview, and an individual interview with each person aged 16 and over. Both the household and individual questionnaires consist of core items that are included each year, and modules that recur on a regular cycle. Core items include household and individual demographics, accommodation, tenure, internet access, environmental issues, domestic tourism, participation in sports, arts and leisure, employment status, health and section 75 classifications. Interviews are spread over 12 months from April to March, with the module on ‘Public Awareness and Trust in Official Statistics’ normally included during the Autumn months (`r survey_start_mth` to `r survey_end_mth` in `r current_year`). The questions included in the `r current_year` module are available in [Appendix C](public-awareness-of-and-trust-in-official-statistics-northern-ireland-`r current_year`-appendix-c.html) of this report.

### Data Collection

The CHS is based on a systematic random sample of approximately 9,000 addresses drawn each year from the NISRA Address Register. The NISRA Address Register is maintained by Census Branch and is created by merging the POINTER database (maintained by Land and Property Services) with additional records, and removing duplicates and communal establishments. The interviews are spread over the 12 months from April to March. Data are collected through face-to-face interviews using CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing) or telephone interviews using CATI (Computer-assisted telephone interviewing). Of the 2,340 addresses selected for interview from `r survey_start_mth` to `r survey_end_mth` `r current_year`, `r sample_size` persons participated in this module of the survey.

### Survey Estimates

Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. Results from surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they have a margin of error which can have an impact on how changes in the numbers should be interpreted, especially in the short term. An estimate of the margin of error due to the sampling process can be calculated and used to produce an interval of values known as a confidence interval. This has been taken into account when carrying out significance tests.

Significance tests were carried out to determine if there were likely to be real differences between respondent groups. The significance tests were carried out at 5% significance level and only differences which were statistically significant (p\<0.05) are included in this report. This means that there is at least a 95% probability that there is a genuine difference between the views of, for example, respondents in 2023 and respondents in 2024 and the difference between these two samples is not simply explained by chance.

### Weighting

The CHS aspires to interview everyone aged 16 or over at a selected household, but non-response either by the household as a whole or by individuals within the household introduces non-response bias to the results. To counter this, weights are applied to the analysis on the basis of age and sex. Weights are calculated based on how the age and sex profile of the survey respondents differs from that of the latest mid-year population estimates published by NISRA. The 2023 mid-year estimates (published in September 2024) were used for the 2024/25 CHS. This weighting process adjusts the results to those that would have been achieved if the sample had been drawn as a random sample of adults across Northern Ireland, thus allowing inferences to be made about the population. The percentages given in the tables in this report are based on weighted data. The totals in the tables are not weighted.

### Quality Checks

Both CAPI and CATI allow plausibility and consistency checks to be incorporated within the questionnaire to improve data quality. Data returned is coded and fully validated by CHS statistical staff, including treatment of outliers and detailed consistency checking including non-credible checks. A 100% check of all coded data is undertaken to ensure that coding procedures are of a high standard.

On receipt of the CHS data, Statistical Support Branch validate and perform quality checks on the data. Range and plausibility checks are performed for returned and derived variables and the data are also checked for ‘missing values’. The data are compared with previous years to identify any unusual trends or distributions, or values that lie outside expected norms. All anomalies are queried with CHS staff who can re-check the coding and source data.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection for the CHS moved from face-to-face interviewing to telephone mode in March 2020. This required a reduction in the number of questions in the overall questionnaire. While the Public Awareness and Trust in Official Statistics questions were unaltered, the change in data collection mode and the number of questions may have altered how people responded to the survey. In July 2022, face-to-face interviewing was reinstated alongside telephone interviewing, thus making the survey dual modality. In 2024/25, interviewers were advised that face to face interviewing should be used where possible.

The achieved response rate for the CHS was also lower than normal in 2020/21 (16% compared to the normal achieved response rate of 55% in face-to-face mode) and slightly lower than normal in 2021/22 (41%). As a result, the 2020 Public Awareness and Trust in Official Statistics module ran for an additional three months (October 2020 to March 2021). While this maintained the precision of the 2020 estimates and has enabled comparisons with other years in the time series, the timing of the 2020 module does not align as well with other years. The achieved response rate for the 2024/25 CHS was 46%. More information is available on the [NISRA website](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/chs-survey-documents).
