# AsmblyArea (available all years); 
#    coded from AA2008 (AA code)
# URBH (only present 2019 onwards; 'urban' variable in 2014 & 2016 different)
# AGE2 (available all years); 
#    names aligned in Historic data to R
# SEX (available all years) 
#    names aligned in Historic data to R
# MS & MS_GRP (available all years, but response options in source variable differ in 2014, 2016, 2019 & 2024)
#    coded from marital (2014 & 2016) and MARSTT (2019 onwards)
# OwnRelig2 (only present 2019 onwards; Religion variable in 2014 & 2016 combines 'None' and 'Refusal/Missing' rather than 'None' & 'Other')
# LimLongStand (not available in 2020)
# Dependants (available all years)
#    coded from DEPEND1-DEPEND3 (for 2019 onwards); depens in source data in 2014 & 2016 
# DEPEND1 (child), DEPEND2 (disab) & DEPEND3 (elderly) (available 2019 onwards)
# Sexual_orient (available all years except 2020 and 2021?)
